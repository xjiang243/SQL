Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN A = B AND B = C then "Equilateral"
    WHEN A + B <= C then "Not A Triangle"
    WHEN A + C <= B then "Not A Triangle"
    WHEN B + C <= A then "Not A Triangle"
    WHEN A = B then "Isosceles"
    WHEN A = C then "Isosceles"
    WHEN B = C then "Isosceles"
    ELSE "Scalene"
  END
